# AATool with Mod Support
a copy of [DarwinBaker/AATool](https://github.com/DarwinBaker/AATool) to support mods.

this is not the same thing! (i don't know how to make it look as good, or have a GUI at all)

## what it does
- nothing (i haven't coded it yet)

## what i want it to do
- parses .jar files (specifically minecraft mods) and tells you what advancements they have.
- can remember what mods you have parsed and their advancements
- you can have different groups of mods (if you play on servers with different modsets)
- can check the world file and see which advancements you have and still need
- ~~looks amazing with cool GUI stuff~~ (idk how to do that, please help)
- can check advancements through minecraft log, by checking if the chat says "PLAYER GOT ADVANCEMENT"
- supports servers where you dont have access to the world file
